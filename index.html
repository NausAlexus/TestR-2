                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text">Rummy stands as a testament to strategic gameplay rather than mere chance, confirming its legality. The Supreme Court of India has affirmed that games based on skill, such as Indian Rummy, are legitimate. Unlike purely luck-based games, Rummy thrives on tactics, calculations, and opponent analysis, making it completely lawful to play online. It can be enjoyed for fun or as a strategic endeavor, recognized as a valid pastime.</p>
                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text">Whenever you engage in Rummy, you embark on a strategic contest. Every card and move carries weight. Skills like pattern recognition, opponent analysis, and probability assessment are vital to your success. You will harness cognitive abilities encompassing analytical thinking, memory, and foresight.</p>
                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text">Furthermore, many nations internationally share a similar perspective on Rummy. As long as it’s deemed a skill-based game rather than one solely reliant on luck, it's frequently classified as legal. Always ensure you participate on licensed platforms to abide by the legal regulations of your region.</p>

                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text"><strong>Points Rummy</strong>: In this format, the focus is on accumulating points through forming sequences. Speed and thoughtful strategy are crucial, as each round impacts your overall score.</p>
                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text"><strong>Deals Rummy</strong>: This variant involves a predetermined number of deals where victory hinges on foresight and the ability to monitor your opponents' strategies, making it truly a game of skill.</p>
                    <p class="RummyZion-info-slide-text"><strong>Pool Rummy</strong>: Here, you must devise strategies to outlast your opponents while effectively managing your cards.
